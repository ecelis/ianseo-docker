TODO: In the Device Management screen, when re-using tablets for a Pro competition that have previously been used for a Live, then tournament activation is turned back to red after a short delay. It could take a couple of activations before the device is actually save for the tournament. I can only assume that the new config for the devices is not being saved properly.
	Gerrit seemed to have similar issues as well. He wrote
	--> Tablet 9 (the Ipad) was target 9 and went back to target 3 of the previous competition.
	--> After qualification and sending the next competition Phase to the tablets, target 3 went from the screen (no target). Still 3 on the tablet.
	--> It happened a an other time that a WA tablet went back to the previous competition
